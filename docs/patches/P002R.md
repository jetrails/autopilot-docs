PHP performance improvements.

## Description

The `opcache.max_file_size` directive determines the maximum file size that can be cached by OPcache. Setting this value to zero allows all files to be cached, which can significantly improve the Time To First Byte (TTFB) metric. Previously, this value was limited to avoid caching large files deemed unnecessary for application functionality. However, further analysis has shown that removing this limitation enhances performance without adverse effects.

## Impact
