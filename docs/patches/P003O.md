## Description

This patch increases the maximum number of SSH keys allowed by transitioning from a single advanced SSM parameter to multiple standard SSM parameters. Each SSH key is now stored individually, removing the previous 8k size limitation.

## Impact

- All-In-One (AIO) Servers
- Jump Host Servers
- Web Layer

## Changes

- Public keys in the advanced SSM parameter are split into multiple standard SSM parameters.
- The `sync-ssh-keys` script is patched on jump and web leader instances.
- Cloudformation template is updated to reflect the new method of storing SSH keys:

## If You Accept

The deployment will support effectively unlimited SSH keys.
During your chosen maintenance window, the patch will be applied to all targeted servers.
New Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) will be generated for each of the servers involved, and these new AMIs will be used to replace the current servers.
Downtime should be minimal and take less than 10 minutes to restore service.

## If You Reject

No performance or functionality degradation is expected, but the deployment will not benefit from the increased SSH key limit.
