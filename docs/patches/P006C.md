Atomic Writes When Scaling Web Tier

## Description

This patch fixes an issue regarding atomic writes when scaling the web tier. Currently, some customers are experiencing issues scaling smoothly because of a race condition that happens when writing to the same file shared over NFS. This patch will ensure that writes happen atomically, preventing any data loss that may occur during scaling operations. The data that is being written is not customer data, but instead metadata about the deployment.
