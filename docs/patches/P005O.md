Null-Bytes Within Rotated Log Files.

## Description

This patch fixes an issue regarding null-bytes within rotated nginx log files. This issue can cause problems with log analysis, as the presence of null-bytes make common tools behave unexpectedly. This patch will prevent the underlying issue that causes null-bytes to be present within rotated log files.

## Impact

There is no expected downtime or performance impact.

## Changes

- Update /etc/logrotate.d/nginx config file to remove strategy involving the `copytruncate` option.
- Remount /mnt/jrc-logs on web tier with the `lookupcache=none` option to prevent stale file handles.
- Allow root user to ssh between web tier and jump node

## If You Accept

This patch will add an extra boot hook to your deployment located at `/mnt/jrc-comms/hooks/boot.d/99-logrotate-P005O`.
This boot hook will make sure that the problem is fixed on every boot, this way we can avoid a jump/web AMI rollup proceedure.

## If You Reject

There might occationally be null-bytes present within rotated log files.
