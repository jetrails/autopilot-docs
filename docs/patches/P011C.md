Default HTTPS Listener Certificate

## Description

The HTTPS listener on the load balancer is currently configured to use a temporary SSL certificate by default. This patch changes the default SSL on the listener to use the actual certificate associated with your deployment.

## Impact

There is no downtime expected from this change, and it should not affect the operation of your deployment.

## Changes

- Changes the default SSL certificate on the HTTPS listener from the temporary certificate to the deployment's certificate.

## If You Accept

The default SSL certificate on the HTTPS listener will be updated to reference your deployment's certificate.

## If You Reject

The HTTPS listener will continue to default to the temporary certificate.
