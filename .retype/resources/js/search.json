[[{"l":"Getting Started","p":["Hello World"]}],[{"l":"Onboard Magento With Deployer","p":["This guide will walk you through onboarding your existing Magento Store onto the AutoPilot platform using Deployer. We will initially deploy a sample codebase onto a new deployment. Although we demonstrate using PHP Deployer, you can use any deployment tool you prefer. Filesystem requirements are outlined in the Filesystem Requirements section.","We assume the store's domain name is example.com."]},{"l":"Create Deployment","p":["Create a new deployment through the AutoPilot dashboard that matches your Magento version to ensure compatibility with services like PHP and MySQL. If your Magento version is unavailable, mix and match service versions to meet your requirements. If provisioning fails, open a support ticket for assistance.","After provisioning, visit the Security tab to whitelist your IPv4 address and SSH key. Find your public IP at ip.jetrails.com.","My IP Address","Your shell access command is available on the Overview tab.","We assume the shell access command is ssh jrc-3p7i-376i@10.10.10.10."]},{"l":"Deployer File","p":["We created an AutoPilot recipe for Deployer to aid the deployment process. Find it on GitHub at jetrails/deployer-autopilot. A sample deployer recipe is in the examples folder, e.g., magento2.php.","Modify the following settings in the deployer file with your values:","We assume the repository is git@github.com:example/example.git and you use deploy keys for GitHub authentication.","Find your cluster user's public SSH key by connecting to your deployment via SSH and running:"]},{"l":"Import Database","p":["Upload your database dump to your deployment using rsync:","Your database dump is named database-dump.sql.","Import the database dump into your MySQL database. Find your database name in the AutoPilot dashboard's Overview tab.","We assume the database name is vo889841yc249h86.","Run the following command:"]},{"l":"Upload Media Files","p":["Upload your media files using rsync:","Your local media folder is located at /path/to/media/.","The --no-p, --no-g, and --chmod=ugo=rwX flags ensure proper permissions on the media files."]},{"l":"Deploy Codebase","p":["Once you have your deployer file, database, and media files ready, deploy your codebase:","If you integrated our example recipe, services like php-fpm and varnish will restart automatically after a successful deployment."]},{"l":"Filesystem Requirements","p":["NGINX and PHP-FPM run under the www-data user and group, therefore, all publicly accessible files must be readable by the www-data user. Additionally, any directories or files that need to be writable must also have write permissions for the www-data user. This is easy to do with Deployer's acl strategy, which leverages setfacl to set extended permissions.","To ensure proper ownership and permissions for the codebase files, follow these guidelines:","The codebase files should be owned by jrc-3p7i-376i:jetrails.","The codebase files should have the permissions u=rwX,g=u,o=rX.","The www-data user should have rwX permissions on writable directories such as var.","If you find yourself needing to set ownership and permissions manually, then follow the outlined steps. Use the following commands to set the ownership and permissions:","To grant the www-data user the necessary write permissions, use these commands:"]}]]
